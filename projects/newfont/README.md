# newfont
This is a sample project to add additional fonts.

## fonts
In this sample below converted BDF fonts are used.
- misaki mincho (8dot)
- misaki gothic (8dot)
- k8x12
- shinonome (12dot)

BDF fonts needs to be in Unicode encoding.
Some BDF fonts are encoded in JISX0208 and converted by my ruby script `src/conv/bdfenc.rb`

Each font has its license condition. Please check the header of converted source code.
