# mrb_in_sd
This is a sample project to load mrb from a file in SD card.

## point to see
The long additional code from `total_demo` is for file select menu from SD card. sd_file_loader() function loads a mrb code onto the array named mrubycode.

Initializing and kicking to run are the same as `total_demo`.
