# spiffs
This is a sample project to use SPIFFS. The implementation is almost same as SD class. File class is imported as same as SD.

This sample reads `data/test.txt` to show on the display.
Upload the text by `pio run --target=uploadfs`

## point to see
almost same as the samples of m5stack-avatar and m5dial. The most different point is that Files class is imported from `lib/mrubyc-m5/src`
