This is a sample project to use multiple LCDs supported by M5Unified.

The code is for M5AtomS3 and OLED-UNIT(SH1107).

## point to see
To activate OLED-UNIT support in M5Unified, write `#include <M5UnitOLED.h>` before `#include <M5Unified.h>` in `main.cpp`. This is a proper procedure of M5Unified.
